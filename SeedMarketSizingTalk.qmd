# Introduction 


## National Seed Strategy Keystone Initiative - Action Plan  

[Action 4. Enhance coordination (within DOI and across departments) to improve the native seed supply chain]{style="color:#6c6c6c; font-size: 0.8em;"}  

- [Short-term (implementation within 1st year of Action Plan)]{style="color:#6c6c6c;"}  
  - **Develop seed need projections for DOI agencies**  
  
- [Mid-term (implementation in 1-3 years of Action Plan)]{style="color:#6c6c6c;"}  
  - **Develop seed need projections for DOI agencies for one-, five-, and ten-year time frames using NISRC national, central coordinating data platform** (see Action #1)  
  
::: notes 
The Keystone plan has three objectives related to estimating the seed needs. Above I have reproduced 2 of the three, the third which is not represented - has a longer time frame for implementation. But should draw heavily from the Mid-Term estimates. 
::: 

## historic seed purchase data  

::: {.incremental}
- Data were collected in times when seed availability is low.  
- the right seed, was the available seed   
- restricted to just a couple DOI regions and agencies  
- unable to provide information on *wants* or *needs*  

<br>

- **All data are contextual -  NISRC is a paradigm shift. **  
:::

::: notes 
While data exists on what BLM purchased and when, the purchasing is shaped largely by availability of seed. As we know the market leaves much to be desired, basing our estimates on low performance purchases will predict a low performance market.  
Further much of these data are restricted to just a handful of regions and agencies relative to the DOI's domain. 
:::

## hesitations of farmers and investors  

::: {.incremental}
- Little knowledge of native species behavior in cultivation  
- Little support from agricultural extensions  
- They are betting on the market  
- Market suffers in low fires years  
- ... 
::: 

::: notes
Yes, obviously farmers need more information on *how* to grow the seed, and get it to market. They understand that the value of seed varies in time, however the value of many commodities vary in time - even subsidized staples like corn and soy. If we can better predict the amount of seed which the gov't can purchase and warehouse at points in time, we can decrease the variation in cost and bring it *more* in line like many other crops

However, this is a country of boom and bust. Most of the West was founded by people looking for fortunes, and I think the possibilities of financial gains outweigh the restrictions that are imposed by a lack of knowledge of the crops.

- Spatial Grain: 30m  

:::

::: {.fragment}
- short-medium-long term   
  - all require a couple core elements  
  - make these robust, while generating deliverables  
  
:::
:::
::::

::: notes
Ideally we could estimate the demand for native seeds for the next 3-7 years reliably. This would allow for a crop to be purpose grown, e.g. for an anticipated wildfire of a certain size. 
However, It is likely to be some time before we can properly estimate the amount of area which will experience a disaster at X point in time in Y space.  

But when we do get there, we are going to need most of the same variables which we need to start gathering now. Accordingly we can begin our estimates of seed market need at both the short and mid term time points, and later incorporate these data into a long term model.

## an R package for seed need estimates

[*Open, Reproducible, and Distributable Research With R Packages* Josh Brinks]{style="color:#6c6c6c; font-size: 0.8em; text-align: right"} 

::: {.incremental}
- Reproducible  
- Avoids duplication of efforts 
- Testable across Operating Systems (OS)  
- Allows others to engage with problems at their 'head'   
:::

::: notes
Theoretically most of our values and work should be transferable to other municipal governments, as well as companies interested in producting seed. 
Further there is one very large DOI agency - the BIA - which I think may not be the most involved in this process, and it seems similar processes will need to be done in Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands may very well just more or less redo much of this themselves. 
So it would be great to be able to get folks onto the same playing field without much effort. 

In the botany community sharing 'scripts' seems common, which yes we can do, but most important is actually developing code of the quality that it can be bound into packages and the functions can be shared. This allows us to ensure that the analyses are actually reproducible, and that the code works on multiple operating systems. 

Forest service has for a long time loosely followed this tradition, although lot's of their software is in external programs making maintenance very hard. Both the USGS and EPA are frequent developers of R packages for various analysis.

::: notes
Pursuing these options allow us to create estimates of the seed need for both lifeforms, and the most commonly used native species in each ecoregion. 
All fire information, and practices can then be subset to any of the combinations above. 
These can ensure that appropriate amounts of seed for each subset is being grown, and can facilitate planning at a relatively fine level.
