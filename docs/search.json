Enhance coordination (within DOI and across departments) to improve the native seed supply chain\n\nShort-term (implementation within 1st year of Action Plan)\n\nDevelop seed need projections for DOI agencies\n\nMid-term (implementation in 1-3 years of Action Plan)\n\nDevelop seed need projections for DOI agencies for one-, five-, and ten-year time frames using NISRC national, central coordinating data platform (see Action #1)\n\n\n\nThe Keystone plan has three objectives related to estimating the seed needs. Above I have reproduced 2 of the three, the third which is not represented - has a longer time frame for implementation. But should draw heavily from the Mid-Term estimates."

As we know the market leaves much to be desired, basing our estimates on low performance purchases will predict a low performance market.\nFurther much of these data are restricted to just a handful of regions and agencies relative to the DOI’s domain."

They understand that the value of seed varies in time, however the value of many commodities vary in time - even subsidized staples like corn and soy. If we can better predict the amount of seed which the gov’t can purchase and warehouse at points in time, we can decrease the variation in cost and bring it more in line like many other crops"

Further there is one very large DOI agency - the BIA - which I think may not be the most involved in this process, and it seems similar processes will need to be done in Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands may very well just more or less redo much of this themselves. So it would be great to be able to get folks onto the same playing field without much effort.\nIn the botany community sharing ‘scripts’ seems common, which yes we can do, but most important is actually developing code of the quality that it can be bound into packages and the functions can be shared. This allows us to ensure that the analyses are actually reproducible, and that the code works on multiple operating systems.\nForest service has for a long time loosely followed this tradition, although lot’s of their software is in external programs making maintenance very hard.
